Here goes my first blog post!
I came across this simple intuitive guide online while I was planning to create an online repository to store all my projects. This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and uses Markdown. It was easier to setup than I thought it would be. The link to the guide: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/
